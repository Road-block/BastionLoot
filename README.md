# BastionLoot Pricelist plugin example

## Documentation
The .toc file as well as the main lua file of the addon have developer notes in comments.

## Intended audience
This is for guilds looking to customize the gearpoint values of items and avoid updates to the core BastionLoot addon from overwriting them.
Some familiarity with addon structure and Lua is required.
